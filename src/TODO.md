TODO
====

* convert to powershell modules and include setup script
  * reason being that sourcing the files directly with the absolute path is ugly
* strip references to luna
  * they are hardcoded and that is ugly
* new script to create user directories automatically on p-drive
  * We need this because without document redirection enabled user directories are not created automatically
